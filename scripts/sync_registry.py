"""Check every source_url in the registry and write a sync report.

    python3 scripts/sync_registry.py

Run weekly by .github/workflows/sync-registry.yml. It reports; it does not decide.
A human reads the pull request and edits the registry.

What it does:
  * requests every source_url in registry/*.json and registry/index.json
  * writes docs/registry-sync-report.md with the results
  * updates index.json "synced_at" only when every URL resolved

What it deliberately does not do:
  * edit a stack entry
  * remove a skill because a URL 404s - a repository can move, and deleting an entry on
    one bad response would silently drop a working skill
  * merge anything

Exit codes:
    0  report written (whether or not URLs failed - failures are the report's content)
    2  the script could not run
